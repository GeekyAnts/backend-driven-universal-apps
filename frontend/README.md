This is a [Next.js](https://github.com/expo/expo) + [Gluestack-ui](https://ui.gluestack.io/) project template bootstrapped with [`create-expo-app`](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# For web
yarn web
# For ios
yarn ios
# For android
yarn android
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`@gluestack-ui`](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/overview/introduction) library that provides optionally styled and accessible components. These components are designed for easy integration into applications developed with React and React Native.
